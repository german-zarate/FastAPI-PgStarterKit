Hello there, coding wanderer! 🌍 If you're here, you probably love FastAPI, enjoy Postgresql, and adore backends. You're at the right place. I've given new life to this long-forgotten project and sprinkled in some magic fixes! 🪄

## Why This Project? 🤔

Because the backend is where the real action happens! It's like the backstage of a rock concert - not visible to all, but without it, the show won't go on!

## What's Changed? ⏳

I took the majestic backend of the original `full-stack-fastapi-postgresql` project, dusted off the cobwebs, replaced the rusty bolts, and here we are! A modernized, faster, and improved version.

## Features 🌈

1. **FastAPI Magic** - Because speed is not just about Fast & Furious movies!
2. **PostgreSQL Integration** - Store data like a pro. No more data loss nightmares!
3. **Fixes, Fixes, Fixes** - All those bugs? Gone! (Well, most of them, but let's be optimistic!)

## Setup & Run 🏃‍♂️

To set this baby up:

docker compose -d
